## Stuff to do

- add comments & specs, modify README
- write methods that transition from edit mode to lap mode
- write higher-level methods that transition between tabs (response to left/right inputs)
	- tab left
	- tab right
	- methods that render each screen
		- pace
		- break
		- units
		- depth
	- depth screen
- write methods that transition between numbers (response to up/down inputs)
	- increment time(interval)
	- increment integer (depth, laps)
	- change units
	- appropriately display modified units

- generate bitmaps for smaller text
	- yards
	- meters
	- "100"
	- "lap," "laps"

## DONE
- buffer & drawing calculations
- tab drawing (pace/break/units/depth)
- tab line drawing (part of the transition between tabs)
- large number bitmaps
